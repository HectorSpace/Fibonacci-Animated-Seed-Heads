# Fibonacci-Animated-Seed-Heads
This is a Python scripted project that uses John Zelle's Graphics.py module to produce multi threaded animated seed head patterns. These include those based on the golden mean ratio (or Fibonacci's Rabbit sequence) 0.618 approx.. The sequences are driven by random variations through time, controlling, size, shape, colour and position.
